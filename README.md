# Hack Technology / Project Attempted

## What you built?

I attempted to build a simple react-native application that implements a stopwatch with the typical start, stop, and reset buttons. I wanted to include page navigation, which is why I also added a simple digital clock that displays the system time. I considered adding a timer as well because this is related to the stopwatch and the clock. Instead, I chose to create something that does not fit here but is pretty common in most applications: a table/list with a search bar for filtering the table. I did not get to finish this feature though.

See assets folder for screenshots of the clock and stopwatch.

## Who Did What?

I worked by myself.

## What you learned

I had a bit of trouble setting up in the beginning even while following a tutorial (listed below). Once I got started on creating the app, everything went relatively smoothly, especially considering that I have very limited experience with react, and I had never used react native before. Throughout this process, I learned about the basics of react native, such as the syntax and the code structure (components, classes, etc.). I got to try using hooks and learned about managing states using them. I also became familiar with many of the build in components in react native. The thing that didn't work was creating a search bar for filtering a table. The task does not seem particularly difficult but I was not able to find a solution in a reasonable amount of time, so I did not include the code here (and it doesn't fit well with this application anyways). The part that I was stuck on when I stopped working on it was keeping track of what was being typed into the searchbar, which is a built-in react native element.
